# Financial Management

 A one-day financial management app written with Express for my own use.

## Fork Notes

 This is a fork of github.com/visionmedia/finance. It is a work in progress attempt at running finance on more recent versions of Node and its dependencies. When
 I forked this and tried running npm install, there were several errors because of non-matching versions between the
 dependencies.
 
 I may attempt to update the project to work with Express 3.x but right now I am trying to get all the original features
 working for 2.x. Ultimately, I may try building on the app to make it more functional for real-world use.

## Running

 Issue the following commands to install the dependencies to `./node_modules`, then visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

    $ npm install
    $ node app.js
